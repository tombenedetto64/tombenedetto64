- 👋 Hi, I’m Tom Benedetto ! I reside in New Milford, Connecticut in the United States of America. 
- 👀 I’m a new Solution Architect in the IBM Technology Garage and interested in learning all things Cloud Native (CN), DevOps, and infrastructure.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the Garage Methods as they apply to CN, DevOps, and solutioning for our client's optimal business outcomes using measured values.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any best practices with design, implementation, measurements, and support.
- 📫 You can reach me here using @tombenedetto64, or via email @ tombenedetto@us.ibm.com
